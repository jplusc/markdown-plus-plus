This is a fork of https://github.com/Edditoria/markdown-plus-plus

It is simply to add support for the 'Obsidian Perl' theme I use (which is a cross between obsidian and conemu's perl theme.)
(although I am not sure where the perl name came from, it is possible I imported a theme into conemu from somewhere now lost to me)

anyway, you can build this version of the repo with:
- make sure git and npm are installed (git --version, node -v)
- go to your fork (cd /d J:\repos\_forks\markdown-plus-plus)
- Install dependencies - npm install
- build so you have the new udl files of the new theme config (npm run build)

copy the needed ones from the \udl\ dir to your userDefineLangs folder (maybe C:\apps\Win64\notepadpp\userDefineLangs)
